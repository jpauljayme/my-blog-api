'He is an anti-hero in the most cynical manner. Yet he lives in most of us.

 A twenty-five-year-old man''s admittance to internal debauchery. Embarrassing... to spell the words out. Yet the need to avoid confrontation of human emotions; of intense jealousy of unmet possibilities lived by other people. The alienation of how society wills me to become vis-a-vis existential plight to be who I need to be - cracks in the surface running deep into the Earth''s core. The repetitive self-description of "a wicked man" is as most vulnerable candor one can possess.

 There is a lot to unpack - the first part of "Underground" brim of philosophical ruminations. On the next part, Apropos of the Wet Snow, his preclude to what has happened before he went underground, a man full of avoidance, anguish, sadness, albeit an self-awareness that placates him at his feet.

 Time will tell when I fully resonate and be objective in the earnest manner. I will read this again sometime this year, after further enrichment of the mind.',

'The right point of reintroduction to the Spring ecosystem, given the gargantuan project it possess. As a refresher, these milestones have been covered :
 1. Spring Core, including Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection, and Bean Lifecycle.
 2. Spring AOP, the ever elusive yet understated hero of preemptive management of methods via advices and aspect.
 3. Spring Boot, the beacon amongst the fauna with its annotation over configuration approach to provide a more out-of-the box toolset for every developer. No more boilerplate code to ponder over hours on end!
 3. Spring Web, the must-know for every developer; from REST endpoints to managing HTTP server-client relationship.
 4. Spring Data, including Transactions, Data Sources, JDBC, and the simplification of the data persistence layer!
 5. Short and concise revisit on Junit Unit Testing and Spring Integration Tests! Mocking is mostly a complex syntactical jungle and I need to do more hands on tests.',

'Self-transcendence. Tragic Optimism. How one should answer life''s challenge of meaning. My words are incapable of fully drawing out the humanity out of life''s enduring suffering. I don''t need to. My statement is the sum of my actions reflecting values. Loving other people and animals. Experiencing the beauty of nature, art, music, literature, and the love-making I do with the world. The struggle of the daily bread I will do with enthusiasm to a certain degree. I choose to stay with my family and pets and see through today that they are well and loved.

 The realities of my past are a testament of my legacy. The surviving from the ghetto into the reality on my own accord; forgiving the bullies of childhood; fostering love in a tense, love drought home; each chapter is my achievement and no one can take that away from me.',

'This is the first epistolary novel I have read. A 20-year correspondence, slow burn, tender, rapturous plights vascillating, of two brilliant writers Virginia and Vita - romance, manuscripts, and all the illicit emotions conceived.

  Virginia''s prose, albeit not having read her works yet, is beguiling like lark''s flight after a downpour. The sensitivity she allures the minds of most bountiful dressing. Juxtaposed is Vita''s often lengthy passages of her colorful social life, of her multiple publications to Hogarth Press, and the donkey that she is, of her myriad of lovers a point of jealousy to Woolf. An affair worth acquainted into. Opening the portal to the history and literature on the onslaught of World War 2.

  Let me perish and find the diary of my life interwoven with gripping passion, enduring grief, wearying acceptance, and the joy of continuing to live in spite of it all.',

The writing is digestable! Marinated with multitple references to literature dealing with disease, death, grief, and surviving them, and I will add them to my list as a person who suffers from chronic pain and grief.',

'2024-04-21' ,
'My first Nabokov book, without knowing his idiosyncratic writing and mischievous protagonists, is a weird, whirlwind experience. It consists of a dramatic 999-line poem, written by John Shade, a distinguished poet at Wordsmith College, New Wye, and the obsession entailing his new neighbor and colleague Charles Kinbote, John’s alter-ego. Charles is always on the prowl for John’s whereabouts, his art, and an ardent desire for control, possession, and validation from Shade''s work, a manifestation of deeper psychological and possibly sexual impulses. A commentary is intertwined within the poem’s structure, basing on Kinbote’s own interpretations, both personal, a story of a Zemblan king, and the colorful passages of a revolution revolving the figure.

 I was unnerved by Sybil, John’s dear wife, on her indifference and secretive responses to Charles, but it is probably her intuition in guarding her marriage and the husband’s art. The narrator seemed to wash out the confines of the timeline, for I have even forgotten that he was a recent alien in the neighborhood.

 Around 70% of the story that my supposed stupefaction by the torrent of Zembla’s history did it finally click for me. From thereon, I purposefully detached myself from the frantic timelines, and the marathon became a walk in the park. The narrator merged with the Zambian king, then transporting into the neighbor in the person of Charles. Hallelujah! The layers of intrigue, with the narration becoming an unreliable web of woven delusion and truth. The nuances are lost to me now! How have I been mislead without a single whiff is beyond me. A lesson of conscientious reading and comprehension in lieu with the millions of literary and scholastic literature is an attitude the reader should possess. Do not trust every single word until a careful evaluation has been made.

 From today thereupon, I declare my love for Nabokov, his pen, and the playfulness his palms provoke, with myself and his readers, and the chance encounter to read such provocative works.',
